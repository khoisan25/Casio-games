# Casio-games
A couple of Snake and PingPong like games written in Casio BASIC. Had a calculator that allowed you to create a custom programs during the 
time I did my A-levels. Casio had(not sure if that's still the case) a fairly active online community [here](https://community.casiocalc.org/) 
with a collection of threads hosting some cool tutorials which were of great help when I was working on these. Compatibale with Casio fx-9750GII Calculator
